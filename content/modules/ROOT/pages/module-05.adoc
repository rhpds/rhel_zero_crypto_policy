Start the Apache service now that the certificates used comply with the
system-wide crypto policy. Now that the service complies with the
policy, it should start without further issue.

[source,bash]
----
systemctl restart httpd.service

You can verify the Apache service is now running again.

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status httpd.service --no-pager

Now that the service is running and certificates used comply with the FUTURE
system-wide cryptographic policy, connect to the Apache service and validate
that the new certificate is being offered to client browsers.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep '^Server public key'
....

Server public key is 3072 bit ```
